# Prior research experience

## _Postdoctoral research at York University_

As urban sprawl has been shown to negatively alter bee microbiomes in certain taxa, and microbial dysbiosis can negatively impact bee health, this research sought to study the impact of impermeable surface area and climate variables on bee microbial communities across families Apidae, Megachilidae, and Halictidae. Studying the differential effects of urban area across bee taxa is particularly important, as urban area has been found to ultimately select for small, cavity nesting, generalist species, and understanding how we can better support other species can lead to better conservation efforts. I also examined bee phylogeny and plant choice to characterize the microbiomes of newly studied taxa and determine which variables have the biggest impact on microbial communities. This paper is currently in preparation, and a second publication that I contributed to, which examined the effects of urban environments on plant microbiomes, is currently in review.  



## _PhD research at Pennsylvania State University_ 

Beesâ€™ nutritional needs vary by physiological condition (e.g., developmental stage, disease state, etc.) and across species. Studies of the nutritional needs of bees and nutritional properties of plants were limited to only a small number of taxa when this work was conducted. To design plant communities and habitats to best support bees, we must improve our understanding of bee nutrition across species and physiological states, as well as how we can meet these needs with different plant taxa. My research increased our understanding of bee nutritional ecology by (1) evaluating how physiological state (exposure to pesticides) influences nutritional needs of honey bees (_Apis mellifera_) [(Crone and Grozinger, 2021)](./link1), (2) characterizing, for the first time, the nutritional needs of mason bees (_Osmia cornifrons_) during development and describing foraging preferences and behaviors of egg-laying females as they provision their brood cells [(Crone, Bresnahan, Boyle, Biddinger, and Grozinger, 2023)](./link2), and (3) determining how urban landscape area influences the foraging preferences, nutritional preferences, and brood cell production of the large-headed resin bee (_Heriades truncorum_) (_in review_). Finally, I summarized current and emerging approaches and techniques used for studying wild bee nutrition and provide a framework for designing studies to develop a more holistic understanding of wild bee health [(Crone, Biddinger, and Grozinger, 2022)](./link4). My research has moved the field of pollinator nutritional ecology forward by integrating multiple stressors with nutritional needs, examining nutritional needs across physiological, organismal, and landscape scales, and providing a framework to design impactful future studies. 

This work developed my research skillsets in bee husbantry, toxicology, qPCR, metagenomics, _in vitro_ rearing, bioinformatics, and generalized linear mixed models. I also gained experience in mentorship, teaching, curriculum design, and speaking about bees to a variety of audiences (technical, extension, and outreach).
